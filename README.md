## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Firebase Project Setup

This project requires a Firebase project to handle authentication, database, and file storage.

1.  If you don't have one already, create a new project at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  In your new project, go to **Project Settings** (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è).
3.  Under the "General" tab, find the "Your apps" section and click the **Web icon (`</>`)** to register a new web app.
4.  After registering, Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. You will need these values for the next step.
5.  In the Firebase console, navigate to **Authentication** and enable the **Email/Password** sign-in provider.
6.  Navigate to **Firestore Database**, create a database, and go to the **Rules** tab. Update the rules to allow reads and writes for authenticated users:
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
7.  Navigate to **Storage**, and set up a storage bucket. Update its **Rules** to allow authenticated users to upload files:
     ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### 2. Environment Variables

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
3.  Fill in the values with the credentials from your Firebase project settings.

### 3. Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
